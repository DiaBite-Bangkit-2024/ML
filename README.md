## ü§ñ Machine Learning

### Model #1

The diabetes model use relevant features from the dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes in user using neural network.

### Model #2

The clustering model to make new data of food dataset. This data will used to make the 'Food Suggestion' feature in our app.
