# DiaBite : Machine Learning

## 📑 Description

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user input and provide personalized dietary recommendations. By combining the power of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for accurate prediction and Machine Learning (ML) for clustering dietary data, we aim to create an interactive and informative health tool. The application will leverage Gemini to provide user assistance and answer inquiries.

## 🤖 Machine Learning

### Model #1

The diabetes model use relevant features from the dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes in user using neural network.

> Dataset: [Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset)

### Model #2

The clustering model to make new data of food dataset. This data will used to make the 'Food Suggestion' feature in our app. We use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for this task using K-Means algorithm.
